# utiliD
A D library with absolutely no dependencies intended for boostrapping the D compiler, D runtime, and other libraries or for bare-metal systems programming

## Rules
1. No dependencies whatsoever.
2. No dynamic heap memory allocation.  Dynamic stack memory allocation is ok, but could probably be avoided too.
