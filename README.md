# utiliD
A D library with absolutely no dependencies intended for boostrapping the D compiler, D runtime, and other libraries or for bare-metal systems programming

## Rules
1. No dependencies whatsoever.
2. No dynamic heap memory allocation.  Dynamic stack memory allocation is ok, but could probably be avoided too.

## Help Wanted
I am much too busy trying to fix problems with the D compiler and I'm not going to be able to work on this much in the near future.
If you like the general idea of this library, please help.

### Tasks

#### CI Infrastruction
We need to set up a CI that can test pull requests, verify coverage, documentation, etc... across multiple platforms and architecture.  That would accelerate any future progress and is considered the highest priority right now.
